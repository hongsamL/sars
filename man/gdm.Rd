\usage{
gdm(data, model = "linear", mod_sel = FALSE, AST = c(1, 2, 3),
  start_vals = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe or matrix with at least three columns, where one
column should include island area values, one island richness values and
one island age values.}

\item{model}{Name of the SAR model to be used to fit the GDM. Can be any of
'loga', 'linear', 'power', 'all', or 'lin_pow'.}

\item{mod_sel}{Logical argument specifying whether, for a given SAR model, a
model comparison of the GDM with other nested candidate models should be
undertaken.}

\item{AST}{The column locations in \code{data} for the area, richness and
time values (in that order).}

\item{start_vals}{An optional dataframe with starting parameter values for
the non-linear regression models (same format as in \code{\link{nls}}).
Default is set to NULL.}
}
\value{
Different objects are returned depending on whether the non-linear or
  linear models are fitted.

  Non-linear models

  An object of class 'gdm'. If \code{model} is one of "loga", "linear" or
  "power" the returned object is a \code{\link{nls}} model fit object. If
  \code{model == "all"}, the returned object is a list with three elements;
  each element being a \code{nls} fit object. If \code{mod_sel == TRUE} and
  \code{model != "all"}, a list with four elements is returned; each element
  being a \code{lm} or \code{nls} fit object. When \code{model == "all"}, a
  list with three elements is returned; each element being a list of the four
  model fits for a particular SAR model.

  Linear Power Model

  If \code{model = "lin_pow"} is used, the returned object is
  of class 'gdm' and 'lm' and all of the method functions associated with
  standard 'lm' objects (e.g. plot and summary) can be used. If \code{mod_sel
  = TRUE} a list with four elements is returned; each element being a
  \code{lm} object.

\description{
Fit the general dynamic model (GDM) of island biogeography using
  a variety of non-linear and linear SAR models. Functions are provided to
  compare the GDM fitted using different SAR models, and also, for a given
  SAR model, to compare the GDM with alternative nested candidate models
  (e.g. S ~ Area + Time).
}
\details{
The GDM models island species richness as a function of island area
  and island age, and takes the general form: S ~ A + T + T^2, where S =
  richness, A =area, and T = island age. The T^2 term is included as the GDM
  predicts a hump-shaped relationship between island richness and island age.
  However, a variety of different SAR models have been used to fit the GDM
  and four options are available here: three using non-linear regression and
  one using linear regression.

  Non-linear models

  Three SAR models can be used here to fit the GDM: the logarithmic
  (\code{model = "loga"}), linear (\code{model = "linear"}) and power
  (\code{model = "power"}) SAR models. Model fitting follows the procedure in
  Cardoso et al. (2015). For example, when the linear SAR model is used, the
  GDM can be fitted using the expression: S ~ Int + A*Area + Ti*T + Ti2*T^2,
  where Int, A, Ti and Ti2 are free parameters to be estimated. For all three
  models, the GDM is fitted using non-linear regression and the
  \code{\link{nls}} function. For ease of fitting, the logarithmic and power
  SAR models are included in their logarithmic form, e.g. the power model is
  fitted using: S ~ exp(Int + A*log(A)), where Int and A are parameters to be
  estimated.

  For each model fit, the residual standard error (RSE), R2 and AIC and AICc
  values are reported. However, as the model fit object is returned, it is
  possible to calculate or extract various other measures of goodness of fit
  (see \code{\link{nls}}).

  If \code{mod_sel = TRUE}, the GDM (using a particular SAR model) is fitted
  and compared with three other (nested) candidate models: area and time
  (i.e. no time^2 term), just area, and an intercept only model. The
  intercept only model is fitted using \code{lm} rather than \code{nls}. If
  \code{model = "all"}, the GDM is fitted three times (using the power, loga
  and linear SAR models), and the fits compared using \code{AIC} and
  \code{AICc}.

  Non-linear regression models are sensitive to the starting parameter values
  selected. The defaults used here have been chosen as they provide a
  sensible general choice, but they will not work in all circumstances. As
  such, alternative starting values can be provided using the
  \code{start_vals} argument - this is done in the same way as for
  \code{\link{nls}}. The four parameter names are: Int (intercept), A (area),
  Ti (Time), Ti2 (Time^2) (see the example below). This only works for the
  full GDM non-linear models, and not for the nested models that are fitted
  when \code{mod_sel = TRUE} or for the linear models (where they are not
  needed). If used with \code{model = "all"}, the same starting parameter
  values will be provided to each of the three GDM models (power SAR,
  logarithmic SAR and linear SAR).
  
  Linear Power Model

  As an alternative to fitting the GDM with the power SAR using non-linear
  regression, the model is often fitted using linear regression (in its
  log-log form). This can also be useful if you are having problems with the
  non-linear regression algorithms not converging for this model. If
  \code{model = "lin_pow"} is used, the GDM is fitted using the log-log
  version of the power model (with log(richness) and log(area)) using linear
  regression. A constant of 1 is added to all richness values if any zeros
  are detected. Using this option is basically a wrapper for the \code{lm}
  function. If \code{mod_sel == TRUE}, the GDM is fitted and compared with
  three other (nested) candidate models: area and time (i.e. no time^2 term),
  just area, and an intercept only model.
}
\note{
The intercept (Int) parameter that is returned in the power model
  (\code{model = "power"}) fits is on the log scale.

  R2 is calculated using the same function as used in the main sars model
  functions.

\examples{
#create an example dataset and fit the GDM using the logarithmic SAR model
data(galap)
galap$t <- c(1,16,2,15,3,14,4,13,5,12,6,11,7,10,8,9)
g <- gdm(galap, model = "loga", mod_sel = FALSE)

#Compare the GDM (using the logarithmic model) with other nested candidate
#models
g2 <- gdm(galap, model = "loga", mod_sel = TRUE)

#compare the GDM fitted using the linear, logarithmic and power SAR models
g3 <- gdm(galap, model = "all", mod_sel = FALSE)

#fit the GDM using the log-log power model and linear regression, and
#compare it with other nested models
g4 <- gdm(galap, model = "lin_pow", mod_sel = TRUE)

#provide different starting parameter values when fitting the non-linear
#power model GDM
g5 <- gdm(galap, model = "power",
start_vals = data.frame("Int" = 0, "A" = 1, Ti = 1, Ti2 = 0))
